# GRETEL: Graph Counterfactual Explanation Evaluation Framework

[!IMPORTANT]\
We are thrilled to announce the launch of GRETEL 2.0. It brings with it a host of enhancements and improvements that elevate your user experience to new heights. The GRETEL framework currently accessible in this repository marks the final update for version 1.x. To access the new version and future updates, we kindly advise you to refer to our official new repository at (https://github.com/aiim-research/GRETEL).

Thank you for choosing our GRETEL framework. We are committed to providing you with top-notch solutions, and we look forward to serving you with even more exciting developments in the future.


## General Information:
Machine Learning (ML) systems are a building part of the modern tools that impact our daily life in several application domains. Due to their black-box nature, those systems are hardly adopted in application domains (e.g. health, finance) where understanding the decision process is of paramount importance. Explanation methods were developed to explain how the ML model has taken a specific decision for a given case/instance. Graph Counterfactual Explanations (GCE) is one of the explanation techniques adopted in the Graph Learning domain. The existing works on Graph Counterfactual Explanations diverge mostly in the problem definition, application domain, test data, and evaluation metrics, and most existing works do not compare exhaustively against other counterfactual explanation techniques present in the literature. Here, we release GRETEL [1,2], a unified framework to develop and test GCE methods in several settings. GRETEL [1,2] is an open-source framework for Evaluating Graph Counterfactual Explanation Methods. It is implemented using the Object-Oriented paradigm and the Factory Method design pattern. Our main goal is to create a generic platform that allows the researchers to speed up the process of developing and testing new Graph Counterfactual Explanation Methods.
GRETEL is a highly extensible evaluation framework that promotes Open Science and the reproducibility of the evaluation by providing a set of well-defined mechanisms to integrate and manage easily: both real and synthetic datasets, ML models, state-of-the-art explanation techniques, and evaluation measures.

## Requirements:

* scikit-learn
* numpy 
* scipy
* pandas
* tensorflow (for GCN)
* pytorch (for deep-learning-based explainers)
* jsonpickle (for serialization)
* joblib
* rdkit (Molecules)
* exmol (maccs method)
* networkx (Graphs)

## Installation:
The easiest way to get Gretel up and running with all the dependencies is to pull the development Docker image available in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/):

```
docker pull gretel/gretel:latest
```

The image is based on `tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu` and it's GPU ready. In order to setup the container we recommend you to run:

```
docker-compose run gretel
```

For simplicity we provide several **makefile** rules for easy interaction with the Docker interface:

 * `make docker` - builds the development image from scratch
 * `make pull` - pull the development image
 * `make push` - push the development image
 * `make demo` - run the demo in the development image.

## Resources provided with the Framework:

### Datasets:

* **Tree-Cycles** [3]: Synthetic data set where each instance is a graph. The instance can be either a tree or a tree with several cycle patterns connected to the main graph by one edge

* **Tree-Infinity**: It follows the approach of the Tree-Cycles, but instead of cycles, there is an infinity shape.

* **ASD** [4]: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) taken from the Autism Brain Imagine Data Exchange (ABIDE).

* **ADHD** [4]: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), is taken from the USC Multimodal Connectivity Database (USCD).

* **BBBP** [5]: Blood-Brain Barrier Permeation is a molecular dataset. Predicting if a molecule can permeate the blood-brain barrier.

* **HIV** [5]: It is a molecular dataset that classifies compounds based on their ability to inhibit HIV.


### Oracles:

* **KNN**

* **SVM**

* **GCN**

* **ASD Custom Oracle** [4] (Rules specific for the ASD dataset)

* **Tree-Cycles Custom Oracle** (Guarantees 100% accuracy on Tree-Cycles dataset)


### Explainers:

* **DCE Search**: Distribution Compliant Explanation Search,  mainly used as a baseline, does not make any assumption about the underlying dataset and searches for a counterfactual instance in it.

* **Oblivious Bidirectional Search (OBS)** [4]: It is an heuristic explanation method that uses a 2-stage approach.

* **Data-Driven Bidirectional Search (DDBS)** [4]: It follows the same logic as OBS. The main difference is that this method uses the probability (computed on the original dataset) of each edge to appear in a graph of a certain class to drive the counterfactual search process.

* **MACCS** [5]: Model Agnostic Counterfactual Compounds with STONED (MACCS) is specifically designed to work with molecules.

* **MEG** [6]: Molecular Explanation Generator is an RL-based explainer for molecular graphs.

* **CFF** [7] Is a learning-based method that uses Counterfactual and Factual Reasoning in the perturbation mask generation process.

* **CLEAR** [8] is a learning based explanation method that provides Generative Counterfactual Explanations on Graphs.

* **CounteRGAN** [9] is a porting of a GAN-based explanation method for images

## How to use:

Lets see an small example of how to use the framework.

### Config file

First, we need to create a config json file with the option we want to use in our experiment. In the file config/CIKM/manager_config_example_all.json it is possible to find all options for each componnent of the framework.

```json
{
    "store_paths": [
        {"name": "dataset_store_path", "address": "/NFSHOME/mprado/CODE/GRETEL/data/datasets/"},
        {"name": "embedder_store_path", "address": "/NFSHOME/mprado/CODE/GRETEL/data/embedders/"},
        {"name": "oracle_store_path", "address": "/NFSHOME/mprado/CODE/GRETEL/data/oracles/"},
        {"name": "explainer_store_path", "address": "/NFSHOME/mprado/CODE/GRETEL/data/explainers/"},
        {"name": "output_store_path", "address": "/NFSHOME/mprado/CODE/GRETEL/output/"}
    ],
    "datasets": [
        {"name": "tree-cycles", "parameters": {"n_inst": 500, "n_per_inst": 300, "n_in_cycles": 200} },
        {"name": "tree-cycles-balanced", "parameters": {"n_inst_class": 250, "n_per_inst": 300, "n_in_cycles": 200} },
        {"name": "tree-cycles-dummy", "parameters": {"n_inst_class": 250, "n_per_inst": 300, "n_in_cycles": 200} },
        {"name": "autism", "parameters": {} },
        {"name": "adhd", "parameters": {} },
        {"name": "tree-infinity", "parameters": {"n_inst": 500, "n_per_inst": 300, "n_infinities": 10, "n_broken_infinities": 10}},
        {"name": "bbbp", "parameters": {"force_fixed_nodes": true}},
        {"name": "bbbp", "parameters": {"force_fixed_nodes": false}},
        {"name": "hiv", "parameters": {"force_fixed_nodes": false}}
    ],
    "oracles": [
        {"name": "knn", "parameters": { "embedder": {"name": "graph2vec", "parameters": {} }, "k": 5 } },
        {"name": "svm", "parameters": { "embedder": {"name": "graph2vec", "parameters": {} } } },
        {"name": "asd_custom_oracle", "parameters": {} },
        {"name": "svm", "parameters": { "embedder": {"name": "rdk_fingerprint", "parameters": {} } } },
        {"name": "gcn-tf", "parameters": {} }
    ],
    "explainers": [
        {"name": "dce_search", "parameters":{"graph_distance": {"name": "graph_edit_distance", "parameters": {}} } },
        {"name": "dce_search_oracleless", "parameters":{"graph_distance": {"name": "graph_edit_distance", "parameters": {}} } },
        {"name": "bidirectional_oblivious_search", "parameters":{"graph_distance": {"name": "graph_edit_distance", "parameters": {}} } },
        {"name": "bidirectional_data-driven_search", "parameters":{"graph_distance": {"name": "graph_edit_distance", "parameters": {}} } },
        {"name": "maccs", "parameters":{"graph_distance": {"name": "graph_edit_distance", "parameters": {}} } }
    ],
    "evaluation_metrics": [ 
        {"name": "graph_edit_distance", "parameters": {}},
        {"name": "oracle_calls", "parameters": {}},
        {"name": "correctness", "parameters": {}},
        {"name": "sparsity", "parameters": {}},
        {"name": "fidelity", "parameters": {}},
        {"name": "oracle_accuracy", "parameters": {}}
    ]
}
```

Then to execute the experiment from the main the code would be something like this:

```python
from src.evaluation.evaluator_manager import EvaluatorManager

config_file_path = '/NFSHOME/mprado/CODE/Themis/config/linux-server/set-1/config_autism_custom-oracle_dce.json'

print('Creating the evaluation manager.......................................................')
eval_manager = EvaluatorManager(config_file_path, run_number=0)

print('Creating the evaluators...................................................................')
eval_manager.create_evaluators()

print('Evaluating the explainers..................................................................')
eval_manager.evaluate()
```

Once the result json files are generated it is possible to use the result_stats.py module to generate the tables with the results of the experiments. The tables will be generated as CSV and LaTex. In the examples folder there are some jupyter notebooks, and associated configuration files, that show how to use the framework for evaluating an explainer. Furthermore, they show how to extend GRETEL with new datasets and explainers.
